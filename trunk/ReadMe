CS6241: Compiler Design - Project Phase 0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
README
~~~~~~

The entire phase0 implementation is divided into 3 passes that are included in the single source file.

To build the shared object, run 'make'. The shared object should be created in the <llvm_build_dir>/Release/lib.

To run the three passes on an object file run:
opt -load <path_to_shared_object> -phase0-rmangal3-1 -phase0-rmangal3-2 -phase0-rmangal3-3 -stats < <input_bytecode_filepath>

-phase0-rmangal3-1: Counts total number of functions and call edges in the call graph.
-phase0-rmangal3-2: Counts rest of the parameters.
-phase0-rmangal3-1: Dead code removal.
